### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### French guy living in OrlÃ©ans (1 hour from Paris by train)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Programming at 42 School Paris
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on last project of the 42 common core: a website for the mighty pong contest
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to start collaborate on open source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about working on meaning projects: medical cares, ecology, technology improvement
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like code and playing the guitar. Learning is my energy, ecology is my belief
