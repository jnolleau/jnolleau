### Hi there 👋
#### French guy living in Orléans (1 hour from Paris by train)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Programming at 42 School Paris
- 🔭 I’m currently working on last project of the 42 common core: a website for the mighty pong contest
- 👯 I’m looking to start collaborate on open source projects
- 💬 Ask me about working on meaning projects: medical cares, ecology, technology improvement
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like code and playing the guitar. Learning is my energy, ecology is my belief
